# Django CRUD API

This project encompasses a fully functional Django REST API designed for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It serves as a hands-on demonstration of implementing serializers and routers within the REST architectural style. Furthermore, the project includes an integration with the React framework to provide a seamless frontend experience.

## Features

### CRUD Operations: Comprehensive create, read, update, and delete functionality for data managed by the API.

### Serializers: Utilization of Django REST framework serializers for effective data serialization and deserialization.

### Routers: Implementation of routers for clean and maintainable URL routing.

### React Integration: A frontend integration using React to showcase a real-world application of the API.

### RESTful Practices: Adherence to REST architectural principles, ensuring standard practices for API development.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

### Python 3.8 or later

### Django 3.2 or later

### Django REST Framework

### Node.js and npm (for React frontend)


## Installing


A step-by-step guide to getting a development env running:


### Clone the repository


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-crud-api.git

cd django-crud-api


### Set up a virtual environment

python3 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`


### Install the requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt


### Run the Django migrations

python manage.py migrate


### Start the Django server

python manage.py runserver


### Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

cd frontend

npm install


### Start the React development server:

npm start

The API should now be accessible at http://localhost:8000, and the React frontend at http://localhost:3000.


## Usage
